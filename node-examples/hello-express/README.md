# Express

### What is Node.js?
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, and it enables developers to build scalable network applications using JavaScript. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and suitable for real-time applications.

### What is a package.json file?
The package.json file is a core part of many JavaScript projects, including those using Node.js. It holds various metadata relevant to the project, such as the project's name, version, dependencies (libraries and frameworks the project relies on), scripts (commands that can be executed on the project), and more. This file is used by npm (Node Package Manager) to identify the project and manage its dependencies.

### What is npm?
npm is the world's largest software registry and the default package manager for Node.js. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) for developers to install, share, and manage dependencies (libraries and packages) in their projects.

### What is Express and why do I need it in Node.js?
Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js. It simplifies the process of building server-side applications, APIs, and web services with Node.js. Express provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications, making it easier to handle routes, requests, and views. While you can create a server with just Node.js, Express makes it easier and more manageable, especially for complex applications.

### What are routes and ports?
Routes are defined URL patterns that an application can respond to. They map HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) with specific controller functions. Routes guide the server on how to respond to client requests to a specific endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method.
Ports are communication endpoints. In the context of a web server, a port is what the server listens on to process incoming requests. For example, the default port for HTTP requests is 80, and for HTTPS it's 443.
What does it mean for my server to listen?
For a server to "listen" means it is awaiting connections on a specific port. This is an essential part of setting up a server; it's how the server knows to accept incoming requests on a given port and respond accordingly. It's like opening a door through which clients can communicate with the server.

### What are the req and res parameters?
req (short for "request") is an object containing information about the HTTP request that raised the event. In response to a request, it provides properties, such as the query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, etc.
res (short for "response") is an object that lets you send back a desired HTTP response to the client. This includes setting response headers, the status code, and the body of the response.
Understanding these concepts provides a solid foundation for developing applications with Node.js and Express, enabling the creation of dynamic, efficient, and scalable web applications.
